      "__label__1 The Backup Plan: Summer reading that does not require much from the reader. I found the plot unbelievable ~ would a guy wait for you for 10 years? They had not even kept in touch as friends! The romance was too predictable. And treatment for PTSD is a far cry from what was described in this story. I skimmed through a good part of this book just to say I finished it. It simply did not hold my interest.\n",

      "__label__2 A Profound Journey!: Lumari's book, Akashic Records, opened a new way for me to connect with greater wisdom. I immediately felt I was listening to a more intimate conversation with the Keepers of the Akashic. While some books try to explain how to access information from the Akashic, Lumari speaks about the collective itself. In this way, I could feel the energies of the Collective and how they perceive the universe and how they gather the information of life. I felt like I was invited into the Akashic - to listen, to learn and to understand.This book is very interesting and opens a whole new conversation that brought deeper meaning and possibility into my own awareness. The energy quality of this book is excellent! The meditation in this book is a profound journey into greater wisdom and spirit. I highly recommend this book and Lumari's other book, Alawashka, too!\n",
      "__label__1 No relief!: The product information says that it takes at least 30 days for this product to work. At 24 days, I was still removing at least 10 fleas from my dog, per day - the same as before I started using Flea Away. I can't believe that 6 more days would have made any difference. And although the many high-dose B vitamins in the tablets are water soluble (i.e., if the dog gets more than she needs, her body will get rid of it without toxicity), the Vitamin E is not water soluble. Vitamin E can increase bleeding risk and I was a bit worried about my little dog receiving too much of this vitamin. I stopped the pills at 24 days with no relief in sight.\n",

      "__label__1 Alterate time-line for the Marvel mob: Niel Gaiman has created some amazing illustrated fiction, the kind that combines literate storytelling with masterful artwork. I regret that 1602 is not part of that ouvre.If you're a dedicated fan of the X-Men, Nick Fury, Drs. Strange and Doom, the Fantastic Four, and Marvel's other standards, you may well enjoy seeing them all transplanted into the early seventeenth century. I'm afraid that I outgrew my interest in those characters some time back. For me, this looked less like an exploration of the comic medium and more like a mechanical attempt to inject novelty into franchises that desperately need it.If the usual Marvel crowd holds your attention, then go ahead, enjoy. You'll probably find a lot to like here. My interests have moved on.//wiredweird\n",
      "__label__2 No better graphic novel for fans of Marvel and History: By placing some of the best loved Marvel heroes into a historic setting, Gaiman has crafted not only a work of art but also a wonderful playground for some familiar faces to play within.I'll admit, as a Neil Gaiman fan and as a Marvel fan, I was predestined to like this work. If you are either of these things, this is a no-brainer purchase. But even if you are a casual comic fan or simply a fan of good stories, this will be an excellent read and well worth the cover price.It would be difficult to review specifics without ruining something. Suffice to say, some of the best moments come from what would be considered normal events in the Marvel universe and how they are interpreted for the 17th century. I should also mention the artwork is incredible and on par with current comic masterpieces. If all you know is the art that appeared in comics in the eighties, you will relish in this advancement.\n",

The author, who lived in Angola for several years, did a good job of explaining the history of Angola and its people from the first contact with the Portuguese up until the independence. The book explains many of the conflicts Angola has suffered and continues to suffer as a result of colonialism, ethnolinguistic clashes, and the conflict of African and european nationalisms.

I realize many think the book is an unfair jab at his family, but speaking from an objective standpoint, the book is damn funny. I grew up in a similar situation, though much less tragic, in Northeastern Italy, and Schaeffer's depiction of the Italian coastal town is beautiful. He correctly identifies the struggles and interchanges that take place in a fundamentalist Christian home overseas. I do not think I have read a more accurate depiction of being thirteen, in a missionary family, in Italy, and in love. It was a great read.\n",

Expect to see this book as a prop in bookcases at discount furniture stores and in new model homes.If you happen to see the movie it's obvious the screenwriter(s) didn't think much of it either. The plot is similar to the book in only the broadest sense.The author probably doesn't care how his novel was adapted, for the popularity of the movie has likely attracted more suckers like me to buy the book.\n",
      "__label__1 Platinum Disappointment: Up in the Air is perhaps the best written awful book I've ever read. Walter Kirn assembles words well, and he's an astute observer of some aspects of frequent traveling. But the story never reaches a comfortable cruising altitude. There's nothing likeable about Ryan Bingham, his seatmates, the woman he occasionally sleeps with, or the family he grew up with. The several weak plots badly woven throughout the book made me feel like I was sitting on a plane, overhearing parts of several conversations, none of which I cared about. As it droned on like the engine of a 767, it was clear the book had no flight plan.A few pages of this sad, cynical tale might have made a good essay; maybe a few pages more could have been spun into a readable short story. But a novel it's not. And the tired little book certainly isn't worthy of all the publicity it's receiving.\n",
      "__label__1 Smug and tedious novel.: Like many other reviewers, I saw the movie first, liked it, and was interested in reading the book. What a disappointment. I found it pretentious and boring. I wasn't interested in any of the characters, all of whom blended for me since they spoke in the same forced dialogue. The whole book felt like the author was showing off but to no effect. I think you could read something like Twilight 10 times and it wouldn't get as boring as this novel the first time.\n",

It describes the concepts perfectly, concisely for the intermediate/advanced student of Spanish to the language's nuances without causing the reader to reach for the dictionary several times over one page.

The following chapters address la formacion verbal, la formacion nominal y adjetival, formacion pronomial, el lexico: diferencias semanticas, tiempos verbales, y los modos verbales: indicativo y subjuntivo. Whether you're a seasoned veteran with Spanish, or still learning, this book is the best on the market regardless of it being older than a few others. The one drawback is that it does NOT use international phonetic symbols, but anyone with some light familiarity with the international symbols will be able to crack this book in no time.\n",

Parts of this movie are decent but the majority of it sucks. If you want to watch a good zombie flick, click next, try something else. 4/10\n",
      "__label__2 Actually pretty good!: It is more focused on character than pure action, but it has plenty of action nonetheless. I was entertained and i hope they do a sequel.\n",
      "__label__1 Really???: Really I know there are alot of Zombie Movies out there but really come on limited bullets so lets shot them Zombies in the belly, leg, arm everywhere but the HEAD the Head is what you need to shot this Movie is no Walking Dead lots of blood and eatting bodys but if you know a blow to the head is what kills them get it done...Big thumbs down\n",
      "__label__2 a grand conclusion for a classic epic: yes I read others writing that they found it shallow or unrealistic unreasonable etc...but for me I found it thrilling exciting and nail biting.I switches back to Jarad as a focal character and his bonding with an eagle which portends war. Along with another mage from a rival league. Civil war breaks out as an evil ghost takes over the power stone of the mages. In the end a curse is broken that binds the dead mages to this realm.I love the combination of technology and magecraft. High tech verses an agrigarian society. I see the writers soap box platform on saving our old growth forest. I live in the pacific north west and have experienced it a lot and agree.I look forward to his next book. I find him a fascinating writer with thoughtful insight and three deminsional characters. A real flare for style.\n",
      "__label__2 Eagle-Sage: As the third book in the series, it was good, but not as good as the prior two. There was a certain tenseness missing that had been in the previous books. It was good, though, to finish the story line, and worth the price.\n",
      "__label__1 Worst Ending ever: This is by far one of the WORST endings I have ever read. The first book may have been good, but Coe failed to expand on any of the magic systems, characters, or subplots that had potential to make this book interesting. The magic system was vague (which is fine for a first novel, but by the conclusion I want some explanation) and unimaginative, as were many of the characters. The book's outcome was extaordinarily predictable. If you have liked this series so far, don't destroy your image with this book.\n",

      "__label__2 The Hag is Back: Best vocals I have heard Merle record since the mid-eighties. I thought, due to age, and other elements, that his voice was headed down-hill. I don't know whether his vocals have improved or if he has just learned to sing slightly different to match the change in pitch. In my opinion this album as a whole, contains his best music in twenty years. None of the songs stand-out above the rest, but they are all solid. His past 5-6 studio albums contain 1-2 great songs surrounded by very bland ones. Recent albums may have had good lyrics, but the music doesn't stand up to the standards Merle has set in the past. \"Chicago Wind\" is an surprisingly wonderful exception to this.It is a shame that most C&W; radio stations will never play any songs that make their listeners think about political, social, economic or environmental issues.\n",
      "__label__2 Getting over the clouds...: William Kershner is a technical author with a flair for humor that is reminiscent of Samuel Clements. His writings are clear, instructional, and pure reading enjoyment. Bill's latest work, \"Logging Flight Time\" is a core book for the libraries of true pilots everywhere. It also is a MUST for non-fliers who might like insight into those individuals who lived during an era when aviators were heroes.Kershner's crisp collection of events from his career will appeal to all who have any fascination for the sheer fun and wonder of flight.\n",
      "__label__1 I'd be humiliated if I was the pilot in this book: The author gives a bad name to professional pilots. The antics of the characters in this book would only appeal to young guys who like to party and drink. Everyone has to start somewhere so maybe the author will improve as he goes along.\n",

I assumed my CD player or speakers had experienced a total melt-down. The sounds on all tracks were so thin and tinny they sounded like a telephone call. So, I checked this CD on two more players. SURPRISE! It wasn't the hardware, it was the CD. I own thousands of CDs and have never, ever heard a recording this poorly engineered and presented. That sent me back to listen to the Amazon samples. This CD has exactly that same horrible level of recording as the samples. DO NOT BUY THIS CD under any circumstances. It is totally useless, unless you are searching for a new drink coaster.\n",

The camera, music and story just float all over the place. Unless you like these surreal type of movies you will be fast asleep within 15-20 minutes.In all fairness I think this is another movie that some will get and others will not get. Seven Psychopaths is a similar type of movie.Maybe this type of movie is for you, but I have no patience for this slow moving type of story.\n",

(I thought I'm Still Here was pretty ballsy.) And no regrets because Joaquin blew me away. People don't realize his acting depth. Honestly you have to go into this movie with an open mind and free time because it's slower paced. Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting was really phenomenal and passionate as well. This movie is definitely an acquired taste.Go into this movie with the acting in mind, not so much the plot or the cinematography or visuals.\n",

      "__label__1 One Star is Generous: Zero stars. I felt compelled to write a review to save people from wasting their time and money on this garbage. I had the misfortune of seeing this movie today with my husband and we both couldn't believe what a horribly written and misogynistic movie this was! Literally people were walking out left and right. The movie attempts to create an engaging storyline that leaves the viewer disgruntled and confused. The ending was flat, like the storyline, and at the end of the movie my husband said, \"Well, that was a waste of two hours,\" and the couple behind us said, \"We were just saying the same thing.\"Save yourself the time, and frustration, and skip this one!\n",

Its very boring, it takes them forever to teach you the moves, then you go through it fast paced a few times and you are on to the next one. I used it once, got halfway through and shut it off. I dont know why they would ever describe this as a workout. If i were you I would shell out the extra 5 bucks and get a better fitness DVD.\n",
      "__label__1 Boring: I am not really athletic person, and I am not in a great shape, recently after pregnancy. I haven't worked out for quite a bit and this work out barely made me sweat. Plus it was quite boring and very repetitive. For person like me any better work out probably would cause some sore muscles, etc, but this did not. If you want fun and little more sweat, I would suggest Carmen Electra's striptease workout. I used disc No 1, it was really much easier to repeat, and I sweat a lot more, and got a little of sore muscles in my legs next day. And Carmen has much better and warmer personality than Robin from PCD.\n",

This DVD teaches you how to loosen up and be cute and playful or a little playfully sexy. The dance choreography is easy to learn and a lot of fun; it's not like some of those other workout DVD's that have you moving in awkward moves that you wouldn't be caught dead doing in front of a mirror much less at a club! You definitely get cardio time and a ton of cute moves from clips of, \"Dontcha\", \"Buttons\" and a super cute burlesque piece.\n",

On top of it, the humor in this show is way over the top and seriously sacriligious. Jesus in a boxing match against the devil getting his but kicked? Come on! The passion of the Jew?

I cried when reading some parts and knowing that when you are living it, you cannot just stop living it, you must go on. The writing is exceptional, not sentimental or romanticized like some books.

Without Ron Gilbert, and without the slightest idea of what the first two games were about, The Curse of Monkey Island, had it been called something else (as it should have) might have been okay.

The essence of the book, a deep and evocative exploration of a father and son relationship, is beautifully captured in the film. The premise, a cross country trip to deliver the National Tree to the President's lawn is well rendered; Andrew McCarthy and Andrew Williams do a superb job. But in an hour and a half, the quirkiness and delight of the novel could not be completely explored.

      "__label__1 Gramatica de la Lengua Inglesa: I find this book quite difficult for the spanish-speaking adult student who I am working with. Any spanish-speaking person would need a high level of education in his own language to comprehend the explanations and directions. My student is perhaps educated through grade school.This would be a good book for someone who is advanced in the spanish language.There are lines for answers, but they are close together, perhaps college-ruled or closer, so the handwriting would have to be fairly small.A good point about this book is that the answers are in the back.There are 127 pages of workbook pages, then there are two appendices and the answers, and one page of an index.

The music speaks for itself, we need more of this type of concerts, the Priests are great, I hope they continue to create more DVDs such as this. Music is another way communicating with God and the joy of the music certainly uplifts every soul who supports good music.\n",

      "__label__2 Great buy: Great little book to start ice cream making with. The intro is mostly biography, there is a section to better understand ice cream making (key ingredients, why you need to use whole milk as opposed to fat free, etc), and the rest of the book is recipes. They have great techniques, but they are often in sidebars, rather than being on a separate page or chapter. As far as the recipes go, it is great- they have different ice cream bases, and suggest in each recipe which base works best for flavor. They also have recipes for sorbets, toppings (fudge, caramel, etc), and other desserts that can be used as add ins (brownies, blondies, etc). It also, obviously, doesn't talk about frozen yogurt. My only problem is that it isn't quite as organized as I would like to get to a specific technique, like adding a fudge swirl to an ice cream. Great buy.\n",

Really not well thought out. There are enough advanced features that an experienced typist can increase their speed or a child COULD learn on it... but MB is so much better.

As far as I know it is legal to make a backup copy of original tapes that you own, for your own personal use under the \"fair use\" provision, just as you can make an archival copy of computer software, as long as it is for your own use, and not to sell etc. The only reason I gave this thing 2 stars is that it might prove useful for transferring home videos to DVD although I have not tried that yet.\n",

Though consumed by long-simmering resentment over Eka's favoritism toward her only son, Marina still makes an unselfish choice to shield Eka from hurt .\"Otar\" is a life-affirming gem, with all three actresses superb in the central roles, particularly Gorintin, who broke my heart as Eka.\n",

The boy's father, Kit Johnson, uses his fishing boat to search for and rescue the survivors of ships torpedoed by the Germans. He later fights a very \"different battle\" with Alzheimer's.

It also reinforces the message of God's Divine Mercy and God's desire to shower us with His mercy when many may think we do not derserve it or even want it. While we can never merit God's mercy, He truly was working through St. Faustina to spread his message that he wants to give his Mercy to all who accept Him and to the whole world which is in so desperate need of Mercy.

If you want his best work, buy his spanish albums -- Amazon has all of them (kudos). He somehow loses the passion and energy on this album. If you like latin-influenced pop music, watered down for an American audience that is too narrow minded to listen to lyrics in other languages, then you will like this album and the other \"latin craze\" music (Martin, Iglesias, Lopez). Latin music has been around forever; it is a shame that Americans think it is now \"the rage\" because a few English albums with latin beats have been released.

While longtime fans wont find much of the salsa here that they've always known him for, there's still plenty of continuity in the fact that he's as fine a singer as ever and a sure romantic.Then again, Marc Anthony has always been about putting his own spin on his roots, so would-be critics should be warned--he wont be tied down. The single I Need to Know, with its pulsing salsa horns and piano, was a ubiquitous item on mainstream radio that clearly rode the fast waters of the Latin floodgate opened by Ricky Martin (Anthony used to sing back up to Menudo)and others.Thats Okay delves a bit deeper into the clave, while the plaintive How Could I combines the fluid fire of Spanish guitar with soft, slow-jam programming. A sweet pop nugget, You Sang to Me offers soaring waves of keyboard as Anthony makes his amorous declarations with breathy urgency.Sexy, salsa king rides the crossover wave.\n",

      "__label__2 A film about patriotic duty vs. love: Based on a famous Thai novel by Tommayanti, Sunset At Chaopraya (aka Khu Gam) has been made into a multilingual film.Set in Thailand during WWII; it's a story about Kobori, a Japanese soldier who unquestioningly takes command of an army base in a region called Thonburi as instructed by his superiors, but finds himself emotionally struggling with his new role and his sense of duty, as well as his deep attraction for a Thai woman named, Angsumalin.Overall, a pretty good film for those who like emotional rollercoasters. Initially, the beginning is slow, but as it progresses, you want to know how it turns out. Kind of reminds you of a certain Jane Austen story, but to mention the name would spoil the film.\n",

The language is not clear and the diagrams are useless because there is no references as how the calculation came to be.

Learning to work with and not against myself has given me help and HOPE.I agree- if you are looking for a how to organize your home- this won't meet your needs.

      "__label__2 A dream of a book: The extraordinary care that was taken by the publisher in the production and design of this book goes beyond beauty. The weight, proportions, paper and typography are something like the experience of the original, or at least, of what the experience of reading was in the time of Colonna. This all helps illuminate the hallucinatory, allegorical text, and for this reader, I felt as if I was inhaling some kind of ether. What breathtaking insight this book provides into the sensibility and mileu of the Renaissance.\n",

But I guess that in the end, it's nice to hear the nice tunes of these classic songs. But it's lacking Stipe and Mills beautiful voices, Buck's superb guitar technique's and Berry's drums.

      "__label__2 figured it would suck but it didn't!: after seeing the trailers on tv for this (quite a while ago!) I figured it would be a cheesy movie with a few one liners - boy was I wrong! it surprised me from the beginning and I can still laugh while thinking of a few parts of it now! I don't even like Cameron Diaz but in this she does GREAT!not one for kids though! I still won't let mine watch but I'm strict like that.\n",
      "__label__1 terrible.: 1st off, Cameron Diaz was grossly miscast in this role. There were probably dozens of actresses who could have played this role better (how does she keep getting job after job after job?? She's an AWFUL actress - at best).Now i like funny and sexy as much as anyone. But these \"jokes\" were just downright crude and not even a little bit funny. This makes the Seth Rogen-type comedies look like Gone With the Wind.Although all the roles were bad, Justin Timberlake did the best job in his, rising slightly above the rest of the pig slop, proving he was actually too good to lend his name to this trash.Its lucky to get a one-star rating here, as you can't dish out zero stars. Avoid at all costs.\n",

      "__label__1 2 Minute trailer far better than the entire film!: I had been wanting to see this movie since I saw the previews - since seeing it, I could have just as well stuck with the previews. It was as if someone filmed short clips and stuck them together - there were many parts of the film that did not transition very well, and there was very little chemistry between the actors in the movie. To keep this short, I will not be watching this movie again.\n",
      "__label__1 Bad Teacher = Bad Movie: I just finished watching this really bad movie and thought I'd jump over to Amazon and see what others thought of it. Not surprised that there are more 1 star ratings for this than 4 stars. Can't believe C Diaz actually read the script before shooting this and still continued. Her career is really in a tailspin after this kind of crap. There's the good part of Hollywood, and then there's this. If Amazon had a way to award 1/2 star that's what it's worth. Maybe not even that much. What's next for Diaz... a TV sitcom? Wouldn't be surprised.\n",
      "__label__2 surprisingly funny: Yes this movie is raunchy and over the top, but I loved it. There are awkward parts and it is R rated for a reason, but this is the best comedy I've seen all year. Don't take it seriously and you'll love it!\n",
      "__label__2 A pleasant surprise.: A reluctant teacher loses her wealthy fiancÃ©' and thus has to return to the job she hates. Desiring breast implants, she pursues the bonus awarded to the teacher whose class has the highest test scores. Along the way she is pursed by a gym teacher, tries to connect with a rich substitute, and finds a rival in a fellow teacher, the funniest and most well-developed character in the film. This is a movie that I found funny and refreshing, in that it is not laced with vulgarities and profanity throughout. This is a movie that provides laughs while not seeking the lowest common denominator. A pleasant surprise.\n",
      "__label__1 The reviews are correct; this movie stinks: 1. This is one of those movies where you think, wonder, perhaps hope that all of the negative review are wrong... because there are well know actors in this film. But this film proves again and again that famous actors + lousy writing = lousy movie.2. Please save yourself some time and money, pass on this complete dud.\n",
      "__label__1 \"Bad\" is accurate for this stinker: This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thankfully I am just out the cost for rental and didn't buy the DVD or see it in the theater. Rather than come up with any remotely funny dialogue, the writers just pile on f-bombs, or worse. The only reason I watched to the end was to see how much worse it could continue to get. The great Justin Timberlake and Jason Segal are totally wasted. The gorg Cameron Diaz should fire her agent. Do yourself a favor and run away from this humorless turd.\n",
      "__label__1 Bad? More like terrible...: There was nothing fun or funny about this movie (I knew the reviews weren't good, but I thought there had to be at least some enjoyable parts -- I was wrong). There was no chemistry between Cameron and the PE teacher. I couldn't tell if Justin T's character was that ridiculous or if it was just really poor acting. There were zero likeable characters and no character development. From watching the movie, I had no understanding as to why the main character was so nasty to everyone. Did something happen to her as a child? A little background would be nice. Overall, pointless.\n",
      "__label__1 bad teacher: BAD is right!!! After the first half hour had to turn it off. Life is way to short. I wouldn't waste your money on buying it. Rent it first if at all.\n",
      "__label__1 Should be rated X: First of all, to anyone that thinks this movie is supposed to be deep, realistic and taken seriously; don't. I don't believe it was meant to be taken seriously, however it's still not funny. Yea, it has a few giggle moments here & there but most of the scenes made no sense. Weak Plot. Too many scenes that tried too hard. It wasn't necessarily boring but simply not funny.The dry humping scene was extra, totally unnecessary. The teachers other than Cameron Diaz were torture to watch. Seems like a lot of things were just thrown together at the last minute from the producer.I recommend ages 18 & older only to watch, anyone younger is just inappropriate. It suits young adults who need a brainless movie to watch while high on marijuana.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointing: I couldn't muster enough faith in the story to prod any longer than page 41. I found it difficult to relate to, sympathize with, or even respect the characters. They were intolerable, existing only to drive the plot. The book professes to extol the principles of cultural tolerance and individual sensitivity, but it fails in this as it attempts to bridge ethnic, gender, racial, economic, generational, and, especially, the individual divide.The characters are pigeonholed in stereotyped behavior, manner, and thought. A stilted performance of a highly advertised and acclaimed book.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointing - Anne Tyler Seems to Have Lost Her Joy: I was most disappointed with this new book from Anne Tyler. And I would agree with some of the other reviewers who think she's lost her special gift. Her characters have lost their endearing quirky edge and their sense of humor. (Who can ever forget the man who washed his dress shirts at the end of his day by stomping around on them while taking a shower? Or the family that always put the groceries away in exact alphabetical order. I could go on an on.) In her last few books, however,her characters have pretty much fallen flat. I fear that this change to more serious, humorless stories is a relection of her own life. It seems that since her husband died, her stories have suffered. I hope she will rediscover her old witty, truly joyful view of life and bring us back some of her mesmerizing quirky characters. I await her next book with great hope.\n",
      "__label__2 Good book: Digging to America by Anne Tyler is a most enjoyable read. Our book club is usually into heavy stuff, and it was delightful to read something that wasn't a \"downer.\"Anne Tyler writes simply and directly. She can capture a scene and emotion with few, articulate, well chosen words. I laughed out loud at the binky party.The main character is really Maryam who is searching for \"belonging\" as is almost everybody else in the book.You'll enjoy this book, It's not a GREAT book, but one that can generate some good discussion.\n",
      "__label__1 Boring: I have to rank this with the top ten most boring books I have ever read. It's my first Anne Tyler book and there would have to be a pretty good argument for picking up another of her books. The characters in this book were so uninteresting. I couldn't connect with one character. Practically the whole book is about planning a party or attending a party. After the first party I pretty much decided that attending a party with these people would be torture! The underlying themes had the promise of making this an explosive book, but they were just left dead on the pages while the characters and parties bored me to tears.\n",
      "__label__1 Great writer, but surprisingly dull and uninvolving book: I've read every Anne Tyler book and usually enjoy them and always find them readable.But this one (I haven't finished it yet) isn't very compelling. A week or more goes by before I pick it up and I think I'm just going to have to set aside a few hours and \"get it out of the way\" which is a horrible thing to say about a writer I enjoy so much.Neither the characters nor the plot are compelling to me -- just seems like dinners and lunches at one anothers homes. The characters--her strong point--seem flat and without a strong plot to move things along...it just ain't moving along.\n",
      "__label__1 Characters In Search of a Plot: As an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction about the transracial adoptive experience, I was immediately drawn to the subject matter of this book. However, I was disappointed and surprised at how the author failed to create momentum or at the very least, a forward moving plot. Much description was given with no action, mainly reading like the background biographies of the characters rather than details that are integrated into a developed story. Most distressing is the lack of three dimensionality to the children themselves, a list of physical attributes and behavioral tics do not make them come alive. I am a true sucker for any kind of family formed by adoption story, let alone one with the outlines of this book as it mirrors my own family, but the fact that I didn't feel moved at all signals to me, an unconvincing and inauthentic rendition of this experience.\n",
      "__label__2 Romance & Politics: The Devil's Paw, a novel of espionage and intrigue during World War I, is very dated in light of subsequent historical events, but it is facinating nonetheless. There is a moderate amount of suspense and action from the main characters, but the thrust of the novel is a study of the political climate of England at that time. Julian Orden, son of a British aristocrat and vocal espouser of the Socialist cause attends a dinner party and meets Catherine, a young woman of mixed antecedents--British and Russian. In her face he recognizes the person who saved his life on the beach the night before. These two characters become caught up in a plan by the leaders of the working people of Germany and England to force a premature end to World War I. I enjoyed this book, but unless you are interested in the philosophy of British politics and the position of Socialism in that era, I would suggest another choice.\n",

I noticed that the author works at my university so I'm not too surprised that it was required and not just recommended. The author, Mark Ryan, is very biased in his view of education. To him there is no place in a classroom for traditional teaching styles. It should be an open, student-directed learning environment where the teacher is a \"guide on the side\". My 8th grade daughter is suffering through this type of teaching right now and I can tell you that leaning too much one way or the other isn't good. When will the education community learn to use a little bit of all types of teaching philosophies rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water?If required to read this text, do so with a grain of salt.

      "__label__1 I didn't love it.: This story of Grace O'Rourke and Rathe Bragg was my second-least favorite book of the very talented Brenda Joyce. The absolute worst was Runaway Bride, which I didn't bother to finish after just a few chapters.This book was very unsatisfying and highly predictable. While Rathe was somewhat interesting, Grace was very stereotypical and cliche, in my opinion. Most of Joyce's fans look to her to really make the pages sizzle with passionate heat, and sadly, this book fell short and it fell HARD. None of the love scenes were endearing or worthwhile. Is this the same author that wrote The Fires of Paradise?On a more positive note, Joyce's use of the deep south during the horrible aftermath of slavery was a very promising backdrop for an excellent story. The plot did not stand up to the setting, and the \"romance\" between the main characters was dry and inspired very little emotion from the reader. If you love stories set in the deep south, you may be able to find some enjoyment out of it.\n",

This book touched me as it was a combination of Ms. Vanzant's personal anguish, trial and tribulations as well as her own victories coupled with the thought-provoking inspiration for which she is famous. INTERIORS is a story of one woman's personal journey through some of life's darkest valleys and in facing these demons, she rises like a phoenix into the realm of self-actualization, self-love and most importantly, self-respect.Although INTERIORS is an autobiographical journey of Iylanla Vanzant's life, it can be applicable to anyone who has experienced pain in their own life. It is guaranteed to touch some aspect of each reader in an intimately close manner. Through her pain and suffering, Ms. Vanzant opens up a path of nurturing and healing like none other!Reviewed by Nedine Hunterof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers\n",
      "__label__1 Not very useful: The book does have a lot of great examples, but that's it. Just examples. It shows you what the author created, and then how he did it. It is not very practical for creating your own DHTML scripts. If you try to create something that he specifically didn't do, you're lost with this book. Definitely not a reference book. I just glanced through this thing then stuck it in my desk and haven't touched it since. Graphics are pretty cool though..\n",
      "__label__1 Not a good \"Trap\": I read the Husband and the Wife trap and I really enjoyed both. But I don't like the plot here. How could the hero not see her as a beauty even before the makeover? It seems that he was also shallow and only took notice of her with new hairstyle and gowns? Anyway, here's the turn off and let's fast forward to the scene when he told Eliza's cousin(the villain) to leave England permanently and even suggested to settle in France. Then on the epilogue, he was telling her about a job that would require them to live in France? How stupid was that? Were they following Pettigrew that they were going to be in the same place with the villain and might even crossed path again? Come on... where was your common sense Kit or better yet Ms. Warren.\n",
      "__label__1 Dissapointing figure for an awesome character: Jazz was my favorite character in the movie. Unfortunitly, it seems the fate of his toy is on par with his fate in the 2007 movie. This sculpt makes Jazz look fat and dumpy. His \"hands\" are half-inch spikes of plastic that do nothing but fold out. On mine, the head would not fully pop out. The fold-down wheels at the feet just look silly. His telescoping sword is a cheap cop-out for a weapon, along with his spoiler supposedly doubling as a shield. The grey plastic looks horribly dull. Jazz is suppose to be about style and cool, not dull. Vehicle mode looks ok. I would pass on this guy.\n",
      "__label__2 Healthy and yummy!: An oldie but a goodie. Book arrived promptly from a private seller. The recipes are healthy and yummy. It is possible to prepare and consume foods that benefit our bodies and brains and this book will help you do that. Recommend highly.\n",
      "__label__2 The game plan: This is an amazing review of history and a blue print of the end. This book outlines the agenda of civilization and it's dire consequence. You can't help from not seeing this play out through the current events of today. Communisum is alive and well.\n",
      "__label__1 Just a BAD Printer: I really want to like Lexmark; I live in Lexington, hometown of Lexmark HQ (all printers are made in China and Mexico), but this is the last one I will ever buy. It is just bad all around:- Feeder jams on just about anything you put in it.- The software is convoluted and confusing (and I work for a technology company!)The print quality is decent but the picture quality isn't good enough for printing photos which is one of the primary reasons I purchased the printer.Finally, the wireless connectivity doesn't work right and required me to physically unplug the printer anytime I wanted to print. FRUSTRATING! I ended up moving it so I could hard wire the machine.About the only positive I can think of is that it looks nice when it isn't printing. Take my advice, buy something else.\n",
      "__label__1 WiFi doesn't cut it: I bought this for the WiFi capability, but it goes down constantly. If you disconnect/reconnect the power it usually works, but if I have to get up to do that, what is the point in having wireless. The printer also tells you that you are out of ink, way before you actually are. Other than that it has been alright. Web support is horrible and based on the reviews I am not even going to attempt to call tech support. I'm going to hook it up with USB until I can afford a new printer.\n",

      "__label__1 Phonics Read & Rhyme: Really awful program. I only purchased it because the school also uses it. The Karoke section makes no sense and it says to play a song, but then none of the buttons are enabled to play one. I called tech support and they said this is the way it's supposed to work until the child accumulates tickets. My daughter accumulated all of the tickets, but it still doesn't play any songs in the clubhouse.\n",
      "__label__2 Takes my breath away: This disk is a truly amazing achievement. It combines heart-felt prayer with unbelievably gorgeous music, and provides an inspiring listening experience. To my mind, the most amazing thing about this music is its nearly universal appeal. People who are not Jewish find it compelling enough that they buy it and play it in their cars and at work.I find it spiritually uplifting and musically accomplished. There is another review here which describes the contents of the disk in detail, so I won't do that. Instead, I will just say that I loved this disk the first time I listened to it, and I like it more on each repetition.\n",
      "__label__2 Wife likes it, but the color is a little different than it looks on Amazon.: Like the look of it. The actual product is red, but it looks a different hue of red than the photo on Amazon shows. The color difference wasn't disappointing to us, but we weren't trying to match it to anything. Just liked the hawaiian look.\n",
      "__label__1 Horrible Media Player: I bought this Gameshark disk for the Media Player in hopes of playing MP3's on my PS2. After numerous attempts with each attempt ending in the Media Player just freezing up I finally gave up. I haven't looked at the other things on the disk, but as far as the Media Player, don't waste your money, it is junk. If it were possible I would give this product no stars based on the Media Player, but then I haven't looked at the other stuff on the disk.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointing: Looking for ways to extend my Spanish I like buying instructional CDs since I spend a lot of time in the car and it's a constructive use of that time. About half of the conversations is on CD, with no rhyme or reason as to what makes it to CD and what doesn't.\n",

      "__label__1 Light Use Only !!!: I was originally very happy with this coat tree, but I now wish that I had shelled out a bit more money for a more sturdy and better built one. While it is easy to put together and provides easy access to all items with a revolving top, the design is poor and does not handle much weight. One of the legs broke away under stress after a month of use, and because of the design, is all but unrepairable without adding unsightly screws or straps for support. The legs have notches which slide in to grooves in the bottom of the center pole, and the notch on the leg is thin and easily breaks away. Also, the base of the coat tree is too narrow which causes it to topple over if the weight is unevenly distributed. I attempted to use it with 1 winter coat, 2 jackets, a full length dress coat, and 2 hooded sweatshirts, and ended up having to redistribute the items often.\n",
      "__label__1 Cheap: Bought this coat rack to hold 3 coats by the door for the winter. Within the first week the support leg broke from the cheap construction of the leg supports. I would not waste your money on this rack.\n",
      "__label__1 Outdated and slow, leading to little Magic.: Seeing as there are many other effecient and productive magical systems avaliable for study, it baffles me as to why anybody would want to waste their time crawling along with this one.If you want to actually DO some magic, rather than simply considering it, or stopping short of really trying it (as this course does), then look elsewhere. I suggest Donald Michael Kraig's superb \"Modern Magick\" if the GD tradition appeals. At least Kraig's book gets to the heart of the WHOLE POINT for doing it in the first place, unlike this volume, which only discusses it in scared little whispers.Magic has moved on, and it's time that fact was recognised once and for all.So... don't buy this book, unless you like the picture on the cover.\n",
      "__label__2 This book is liberating to women everywhere: This book is liberating to women everywhere! The reason I bought this intriguing book was that my Grandmother Didi Moorman is actually in the book! pgs., 17, 111, 113, 120, 151.\n",
      "__label__2 Love this idea!!!!: Great idea - my kids were so excited to turn them on and brush the whole time. They are a bit hard to turn on for my 3 and 5 year old so I have to do it for them (no big deal). They are at Target for $1 - stock up (why they are $6 on amazon is a mystery to me - what a rip off).\n",
      "__label__2 Amazing...I was able to set it up in less than 10 minutes: I bought this item for my office for occasional watching of news or special event and to replace my 5\" B/W tv. I was able to install this in minutes and it works extremely well. I can watch TV in a resizable window while working. The picture qyality is acceptable on full screen (17\") but excellent in a 5\" by 5\" window. Sound quality, very good. The only thing that worries me it that the unit gets very hot...but it has vent holes all over for keeping it cool...so, maybe it is supposed to get that hot.I have not tried recording a program yet...but reading other reviews, I understand it maybe a problem. But, for $25 after mail-in-rebate from Buy.com...it is far superior than my 5\" B/W TV with poor sound and flickering picture...I am going to give a proper burial to the B/W TV soon and reduce clutter on my desk.\n",

      "__label__2 Must Have: Don't be afraid of factory reconditioned. Mine arrived packed and perfect just like a new one except much less expensive. This is a great tool all around. The crown stops and vertical clamp should be included. I've taken the skin off my knuckles when I let one finger outside of the handle when lowering the blade. It gets caught by the blade guard and takes flesh right off. Minus 1 star for the blade guard removing my skin unecessarily.\n",
      "__label__2 Nothing wrong with reconditioned: Seems to work great. I don't use it for a lot of heavy duty stuff, but for what I have used it for, I can't find any problems. Only negative might be the dust catcher (it doesn't seem to work very well) but I haven't ever seen one that does, so I still give it 5 stars.\n",

My mistake was ordering from another source through Amazon, and although they show the product description as same with \"2 miracle balls included\", only a book arrived. I can tell you that you do not get the same results rolling around on the book. The 2 small balls make all the difference. Be sure that the product description is accurate. I was told by seller that they would not accept return.\n",
      "__label__2 Some relief from back pain: I have some knots and general tightness in my back and was looking for something that might be helpful. I considered some of the back alignment products but hesitated because of the price. Since it costs a fifth of the price of a single massage I decided to try this product. I've only used it a short time, but feel that it has made a small positive difference.\n",
      "__label__2 works great: I am a dog groomer and my muscles really take a beating. My massage therapist told me about these and how I should use them as maintenece. Wow! am I glad she did my neck and shoulder doesn't freeze up and I can work without pain\n",
      "__label__2 Cured My 20+ Year Stiff Neck: By placing one ball under my neck and rolling my neck around for a few minutes, I am able to turn my neck while driving without feeling the usual stiffness and pain. In fact, I can roll my head in almost any direction without neck pain for the first time in at least 20 years. To work the sides of my neck, I placed one ball on a tailor's ham (used in sewing) so that my shoulder would have room while laying on my side with the ball fully supporting the side of my neck. After 15 minutes of gentle rolling my neck on each side, I have no side neck pain for the first time in decades. I can't recommend this product enough.\n",
      "__label__1 not as I expected: I was so hopeful that this would work. When I used the balls, I found it painful and was very sore the next day. Might not be for people with fibromyalgia. I might try again but I'm a little wary.\n",
      "__label__1 These little balls did very little to help my pain.: I am disappointed with this product. Most of the exercises are basic stretches, which do not require the balls. The balls do feel good while using them, but do not provide relief beyond that. In fact, I'm not so sure that they don't make painful areas worse. The smell of the balls is horrendous. I have no idea why everyone has written so many good reviews. I've had several of my friends try them out also and they think that they're just a waste of time. I would certainly not purchase again.\n",
      "__label__2 Great invention: These balls do what they are supposed to do-relieve back pain. Love them. Gave a set to my brother-n-law who has back issues and they did the trick.\n",
      "__label__1 This music requires an almost supernatural technique...: Composer Godowsky has beautifully augmented the Etudes of Chopin, adding textures and even extra melody lines, with just two hands expected to somehow play it all. Carlo Grante is a very good pianist, but this music requires amazing dexterity. This is a noble attempt, but too often Grante is forced to break the rhythm and fluidity of the pieces in order to accomodate the extra material. Many of the pieces are simply played too slowly. Imagine Chopin etudes plodding like dinosaurs, like someone's got a thumb on the record! Marc-Andre Hamelin has the supernatural technique to play these pieces well. Grante plays some of the studies well enough. It's interesting to hear him attempt some of the most complex pieces ever written. But perhaps he needs another few years of practice. Someone wrote that Grante has re-recorded these pieces for release this year. It should be VERY interesting to see what eight extra years of practice has yielded!\n",
      "__label__1 Nonsense.: Grante has no idea at all of style appropriate to this idiom. Most of these are unrecognizable. No sense of texture, tone, legato, or anything else that would have meant anything to Godowsky. Check out Godowsky's American records, e.g. the Berceuse, (not the Columbias) to hear what I mean. As bad as I've heard since Szidon's hysterical Scriabin or Pollini's brutal Chopin. No bueno. Really no stars at all.\n",
      "__label__2 Good place to start: Although a bit outdated (especially s far as examples and tables are concerned) this book is still a good starting point for those who wants to begin with their research in astro economics and astro trading: for example, if you have never read an Ephemeris table before then section two of the book will explain you how to do it. One important point: this book makes reference to moving planets \"aspects\" and their correlation with turning points in the market: it has little to do with financial astrology , here you will not find corporations' horoscopes, first trade dates or stuff like that. Another observation: this books is very simple to understand: the author writes about astronomical cycles without mentioning equations, signals theory and celestial mechanics concepts, great for beginners, maybe this a limit for those more into this subject.\n",
      "__label__2 Excellent!: This is a WONDERFUL cd of solo and chamber works by this composer. It's amazing how much great music there is out there waiting to be discovered. This guy's music is amazing. It really pulled me in and captivated me. It is approachable, with lots of excitement, but also tons of heart. I'm hooked! Highly recommended!\n",
      "__label__1 Technical Errors: There are so many books 'how-to' books out there on mosaic technique. Some are accurate, clearly based on extensive practical knowledge and experience, and some have very misleading and incorrect information. I'm afraid this book falls in the former category. When an author mentions using Elmers craft glue to create a mosaic or seal a substrate, then I would hesitate to trust any of the other information in the book.For a proven 'how-to' book on creating mosaics, I would suggest 'Mosaic Techinques and Traditions' by Sonia King or any of the books by Emma Biggs, Tessa Hunkin, or Elaine Goodwin. These are all working mosaic artists and instructors and the techniques they share can be counted on to provide you with a solid foundation in this wonderful art form.\n",
      "__label__2 Great calming liquid: I got a rescue dog and for the first few days he was very difficult. When I left he would bark and howl for hours. My rescue contact suggested that I try Good Boy. After one day of adding it to his water, he became totally different. Slept like a baby while I was gone and when I got home was back to normal. It seemed like I was drugging him b/c it was so effective. But he is very normal and active whenever I was around. Odd. After a few days I decided to stop putting it in his water b/c I was worried that it was too much. But after that, he just stayed calm all the time. I think it helped him make the transition to being in a new house with a new owner. Ever since then, he has been just fine and not hyper active anymore. It really saved the day for me! (and him...) I recommended it to my friends with over-active dogs and I'm waiting to hear what they say after they buy it for their dogs.\n",

      "__label__2 My son LOVES this book: My son is 7 months and loves this book. This says a lot since I can't get him to hold still to change his diaper - yet he will sit and let me read him this book over and over. Great for learning bye-bye, peek a boo, and mama/dada and the 'pop-up' Baby Elmo at the end is great and always gets a baby laugh!

      "__label__2 Tells the True Story: I think that this book was a great example of a true biography of a person. Ricky Martin is a great preformer who has only been on this earth for such a short time and has already achived so much sucess with much more to come. This book portrays his life in a great light and allows the reader to feel as if they know Ricky after reading this book. It is not a teen bopper book about Ricky but rather a window into his exciting and sometimes heart breaking life's story.\n",

I have totally abused this knife and it still looks and works incredible. There is no better knife for the money! I am a regular guy from Wisconsin, and this is my honest opinion.

He's more Frank Sinatra than he is Elvis Presley and you know what? He is comfortable with that. This Album is a great master piece and has the collaboration of such great composers as the argentine composer Bebu Silvetti and His Mexican compatriot The master of such hits as \"It's impossible\", \"Adore\", and \"Yesterday I heard the rain\", the legendary Armando Manzanero. This album celebrates love and not sexuality. The songs that stand out in this album are \"Sol arena y mar\", \"o tu y ninguna\", \"Quiero\" Dimelo en un Beso\" and \"Tu solo Tu.\" This album is a combination of pop/Jazz/ballad/classical woven together. This album has up tempo songs and easy listening romantic songs. Overrall this is one of Luis Miguel's best albums. And it includes songs written by the artist himself.

And, it explains that there can be more than one \"first born\"!

      "__label__1 Lacking.: In 1986, no doubt Ronald Shannon Jackson had a challenge on his hand-- the Decoding Society had pretty much scattered, and with the loss of such powerful musicians, assembling a new band to succeed them was a difficult task. The second generation Decoding Society, guitarist Cary DeNegris, bassist Reginald Washington, violinist Akbar Ali and saxaphonist Eric Person on this recording persons in conjunction with African singers/percussionists Twins Seven Seven. The result of the collaboration, while interesting, lacks much of the fire that the older Decoding Society had.By and large the pieces are invested in funky African rhythms, they have a nice sound, the playing is good all around (particularly Washington, who adds a good slap funk sensibility and slithers nicely between Jackson's rhythms), but there's by and large something really quite unfulfilling about the record. It just doesn't burn. The band did much better work, this is a curiosity piece more than having any intrinsic value.\n",

The basic premise of the book is that the Kabbalah can best be grasped as a physical reality by walking through the tree.

While it was a novel approach at first, it has started to wear thin and I kind of wish writers wouldn't use it so frequently. In nay case, this book lacks character depth because of how it is formatted (emails only) and it's hard to follow the thread of the story sometimes because of it. The central plot was a romance, a triangle romance, where the heroine is caught between 2 lovers. It wasn't a really good book and I wouldn't recommend it. The characters were not very interesting and the exploits of the main character were not as adventurous as the title and preview made it seem. I think the story would have actually worked much better if it had written in a traditional format.\n",

      "__label__1 Big letdown: Like several other people have commented, I purchased this book based on the excellent reviews. It is a decent story at best. Several things need to be said: it is NOT, by any stretch of the imagination, scary. There are several creepy sequences, but that is it; NOT horror. Second, the book does essentially NOTHING - a very slow, boring, tedious, and pointless \"build\" - until the last 100 pages (out of 480 is ridiculous). It really isn't building much. It could have been said easily in 150 pages vs 380. All-in-all, I would chalk this up to a bunch of people reviewing being a little downsy, as well as ridiculous. Anyone that says this is \"scary!\" or \"terrifying!\" shouldn't read horror novels whatsoever. I've read my share of horror fiction, and this is easily the worst and least scary.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointed: I have to admit that I was very disappointed with the novel after reading the glowing reviews. This book was probably one of two books I have never finished. I just could not bring myself to complete it. I honestly found no character that pulled me in emotionally. Everyone seemed to be caricatures of one fault or another, including the father and daughter. In all honesty, my opinion of almost every book or movie rests with the abilty to care about at least one character. In this book, I found no one. I was turned off by every person in the story. And as for the chills, I did not see what the other reviewers saw.I have never been one to put someone off of something. But this time I just had to write something down. Judging by all of the other reviews, I am in the extreme minority. I may give another of Tamara Thorne's novels a try. It may have just been this particular book.\n",

      "__label__2 A Wiersbe classic that all should read: Christianity is a relationship between God and each believer, with Jesus being the mediator (First Timothy 2:5). That relationship sometimes breaks down because we frail humans always want to take the easy way out. The easy way out is to make rules about how we should live, such as \"never drink alcohol\" and \"never go to movies.\" Wiersbe explains why rules like those are detrimental to a believer's growth. He explains in simple but precise ways that the Law of Moses was intended to cause each of us to realize two things: (1) we cannot please God by following the Law because we can't follow the Law (2)and the Law was designed to teach us that we need a savior from the Law. That savior is none other than Jesus, the mediator between a holy God and unholy mankind. Wiersbe's book is simply a great book. Read it and Be Free!\n",

      "__label__1 Action packed but hard to enjoy: It is the newest thing for hollywood directors to give you the moving camera action shot. To my knowledge the new James Bond Series does it most...and best. However there have been tons of other films that have attempted to emulate this technique and have failed..sadly 12 rounds is one of them. The moving camera is supposed to give the viewer the feeling of being in the action, or an actual by stander to it..and does work sometimes. The problem with 12 rounds is that there is barely a steady shot in the whole film. This film seems like it was directed by a first time director with no real concept of filming a movie. Instead of feeling like you are at the scene of the action, the busy camera is distracting and diminishes from what might have been a better film in the hands of a more competent director....and Mr. Cena..doesn't help..he's not the greatest lead...and needs better support in front of and behind the camera if he is going to shine.\n",

The main character, the faithful monk Tenzin, is very likable, and your heart goes out to him when he expresses doubt that he is up to the task of finding his teacher's new incarnation. There is a scene where he revisits his late teacher's now-abandoned and ruined retreat home, and he is overwhelmed with sorrow and begins to cry. Depictions like that abound in this film - moments of touching human-ness that make you realize that people are the same all over the world. There are also moments of joy, like the scene where Tenzin and his reincarnated master, now a very young boy, are both trying as fast as they can to make bottles of soda pop foam up and spill out over the glass.

He really gives you an insight into the daily lives and tribulations of ordinary people you might otherwise ignore and depicts them in bizarre circumstances at times that give them an opportunity to show their inner strength in a truly memorable way.

In comparison to \"Ticktock\" or \"Watchers\" or a host of others, this one is a real sleeper. Sometimes I scan a chapter and see nothing, then go back to read it in detail and find the same.

She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old.

I took my grandmother and my aunt to see her in concert, and they were overwhelmed. My mother has compared her on more than one ocassion to the fabulous (and in our opinion the true queen of ranchera), Amalia Mendoza. Amalia never got the attention she deserved, but I sure hope Nydia does. I can only compare her to Amalia and Maria de Lourdes. If you are a fan of Ranchera and Mariachi, you will understand what I mean when I say that Nydia \"cries\" when singing. I love her current album, but I hope that she will make an album of old Mexican standards, such as the one Luis Miguel did. It would truly bring Nydia the attention and respect she deserves.

I knew it was a risk purchasing them considering how low they were priced. Each individually wrapped package had several paper towels hanging out of it and when you open them to put them in the dispenser you end up having to remove the first 4-6 paper towels to get to the ones that actually pull down nicely. Again given the price this is to be expected. The paper towels themselves are fair to poor in absorbancy thus my lower rating. You end up using twice as many to dry your hands as you would if you had purchased a higher quality paper towel. This is a case of you get what you pay for. If you are looking for budget paper towels and don't mind the above you will like these.\n",

And as a Computer and A/V tech, I can relate to people just like the characters in the show; but I do not, never have and never will find bathroom humor amusing in any form.

I work frequently with students who have been diagnosed with Autism, and I have found that this is one book that students really enjoy. There are great pictures and stories that my students love to see and read. We typically act the stories out afterward either in person or with dolls/action figures.

The book uses real photos of children in various situations to teach the right way to do something, like stand in line, and also shows a photo with the wrong way. It explicitly teaches, among other things, how to approach other children to play, how to ask a teacher for help, and how to have a conversation. My son loves reading the book together and I can already see him implementing the lessons after just a few weeks. For visual, step-by-step learners, this book is perfect. I own at least 6 books on teaching social skills and this is by far the best and most effective one I've used.\n",

Obviously ridiculous and after an email to the seller through Amazon, I was told the openers were on their way and I did, in fact, recieve them after 10 days. I also expected the openers to look like the picture. They did not. It's a plain opener. It does not say Worlds Greatest Bottle Opener. It's plastic. It works, but it's nothing special.

I'd consider myself a francophile, but even Versailles looks restrained in comparison to Strasser's layers upon layers upon layers. I'd hate to clean in any of these rooms.

The second CD is my favorite of the two, I recommend tracks 4, 9 and 11 -all of which were discovered while napping on the train to work. I also recommend Darey's Ibiza release within the Euphoria collection.at best: you have a CD with mellow tunes to chill to, and plenty of thumping sets to throw parties withat worst: you'll find a few no-namer DJs with good sound that might be worth checking out on MP3\n",

I paid less than $30 dollars for this Brother 575 Fax and that included shipping. It came with ink pre installed and works beautifully. A real bargain!!\n",

I got a 5.1 sourround system but the PCM Stereo sound on this DVD is too bad. When you have an old TV and the complete sound comes out of it, you may don`t have a problem with the sound. But I do! How can someone who owns millions and gives an expensiv concert, release the DVD in such a horrible sound? Wisin y Yandel released their tomando control Live DVD in 5.1 sound.\n",

The company says that one drum unit can be used for 12,000 pages assuming 5% coverage. This is not true.

However when I originally saw Hilary playing on a local public TV station that runs a program that plays various classical music videos. A little promotional/documentary about this CD was playing and I was simply entranced by the music I heard. Becoming an instant \"fan\" I bought 4 of her albums, and this one I believe is head and shoulders above the rest. I don't know if it's simply the selections of music by Bach or her obvious mastery of the violin that make this CD such a joy to listen to for me. All I know is that I can't wait to hear more recordings from this great musician!\n",

I was looking forward to listen to her Bach violin concertos. But when I heard them, I was really disappointed. She plays them technically perfect, but this is not what I heard in the music hall. Her violin concertos are not inspiring. They have no soul, no meaning. I wish she played them like she plays the Bach partitas.A dissapointed Dutchmen\n",

If you are looking for a recording of a performer who pays attention to performance practice of baroque era music you will be disappointed.

All said though, this is a beautiful recording that I enjoy even though I know that it is not as Bach would have wanted it played.\n",
      "__label__1 A Misstep: I have loved every previous Hilary Hahn recording, and given them all 5 stars. This one is a distinct misstep. It is just too fast.

Had I heard this recording blind, I never would have thought this was Hilary Hahn. Such a shame.\n",

This is a skimpy foray into too deep waters for a beginner. Have you ever read a good Tudor biography that was only 156 pages long? Can you imagine that there are any significant facts, details, insights in so few pages? Well, you're right--there aren't! What we do have are stereotypes (dirty old king, lusty Chaucerian wench, stupid courtiers, etc.). What is most egregious is that there is never even an attempt to explain why and how Catherine and her cohorts could have made so many stupid mistakes, how they could behave as if there had never been an Anne Bolyn: that's the mystery that has always fascinated me about Henry's \"rose without thorns,\" but you'll find no answers here. Please save your money, your time, and be a bit more patient. Eventually, someone is going to write a truly good historical novel about Catherine Howard.\n",

Over time (about 4 months I would guess)my hair has taken on a bluish tint. The person cutting my hair noticed first (I get my hair cut about once a month). Then my wife noticed. The bluish tint began so slowly, I really didn't notice, much to my chagrin and self admonishment. But, when called to my attention, my hair clearly had the faint bluish tint. I have now changed shampoos after years of Crew use. I suspect it is something in the formula that was changed over the last year or so. I, of course, don't know for sure, but the color of the shampoo and the fact it was first noticed by the person who has been cutting my hair for years, leads me to this conclusion.David T.\n",

We should be speaking of an influx of traditions found in Thomas into Gnosticism, not the influx of Gnosticism into Thomas. The future of research on possible connections between the Gospel of Thomas and Gnosticism should be moving in the direction of exploring the influences that this non-gnostic Gospel's ideology may have had on emerging second century gnostic systems.\n",

I am incredibly disappointed that he would include this person on his list of reputable and respected mediums, as this person is merely an actress, nothing more.

He features highlights of experiments with medium Allison DuBois, but Schwartz' bias in favor of his subject matter makes this book an epiphany of self-celebration. There is a fascinating section, The Monty Keen Experiment, and the results seem extremely remarkable -- why isn't it published in Science Magazine? Talk of \"Replication and Extension Reading\" is confined to Mr. Schwartz's \"Lab,\" and we're left wondering if any of Schwartz's experimental designs or raw data are being shared with other universities. Why sacrifice scientific method for sensational tidbits? Oh, yeah! The book's release coincides exactly with the new fall TV season of MEDIUM.\n",

Show me the proof that our bodies operate at a particular \"vibration\" and it is this vibration that either attracts or repels things in our lives. This book does not offer that proof, and neither can you.

However, extract the music from the movie, and what you have are 10 tracks that all sound about the same. To sum it up in one word...boring.

      "__label__1 DOES NOT WORK WITH PS3!!: I recently purchased this product with the expectation that I would be able to plug in the adapter and instantly use my Guitar Hero guitars. This was not the case. When I got the adapters, the first thing I noticed was the packaging which stated the product was a \"PS2 to USB (PC)\" adapter. The PS3 has USB ports so I thought this wouldn't be a problem. However, upon plugging the adapter in, I found it wouldn't register the guitars. After further investigation and several minutes of frustration, I noticed a disc included in the packaging marked \"Drivers\". Obviously this presented a problem as the drivers had to be loaded in order to use the adapters. As I haven't yet found a way to load drivers in to the programming of the PS3, I was unable to use the adapters with the console. Bottom line: Don't buy these adapters for use with you PS3. There are adapters out there that are specifically made for the PS3 and work for that application.\n",

The PS button brings up the console screen, but no scrolling is possible and it takes control away from any other guitar connected. If you can actually get it into gameplay, the symptoms are similar to those experienced with other Guitar Hero games (no star power deployment using tilt, etc.). DON'T BUY THIS if you want to play Guitar Hero on PS3; suck it up and get the new wireless guitar(s) made for the system.\n",

Additionally, I've already come across several other major errors in the code examples, more than found in the online errata section. I guess listing them all would be too embarrassing!Sure, the book is an easy read. It's an easy read because it's neither in-depth, nor detailed. Often, a lot of concepts in the code examples are never explained properly.Using ASP.NET???

      "__label__2 A nice package all around: This is really a very nice collection of love songs from Elvis. I wish the tracking order had been in chronoligcal order by year, but otherwise I'm very happy with the collection. I purchased it for the unreleased studio version of \"For The Good Times\" which is nice, but in my opinion does not come close to the live version on the Madison Square Garden album. For those that are new to Elvis thanks to the #1 hits and 2nd To None collections this will be a great way to hear a little of the different styles of music Elvis was capable of. I do have to say that \"Unchained Melody\" is a stand out on here as every Elvis fan knows that this was close to the end for him, but the voice was stronger than ever. Sure Elvis fans will have these songs in their collections already, but the remastering job by Vic Anesini is stellar and it brings new life to these classics and will not disappoint.\n",

Part European travelogue, Buruma travels from Voltaire's home in Ferney, to Germany, to Holland, and to Great Britain; part philosophical reflection, part history, and part autobiography, Buruma ties together all the strands in a perfectly beautiful bow. Wonderfully written, with unforgettable profiles of major historical and literary figures. \"Laughter is Forbidden!\" announced the Germans as they produced Shakespeare's plays -- but laughter, tears, and insights are the inevitable outcome of a few hours curled up with \"Anglomania: A European Love Affair.\"\n",

It can hold 3 toddlers comfortably and has provided lots of fun so far! The one and only issue is that i often sit on the front claws so i can play with my baby, they have now dented badly...and i am not hugely heavy either!

I cannot really remember the film very well, because I was too busy clowning around at the back of the room with a few classmates in order to avoid having to watch it. It just did not capture my interest. Years later, I went online and read about the summary of the book and concluded that I really had not missed out on something that I would regret having missed out on, since it's just another little-guy-against-big-corporation story. I am very sorry if I've offended anybody with my critique of this film, because it is fine with me if you love it; I just did not. Also, I apologize to the makers of this film if I have insulted them, and also to the author who wrote \"Hoot\" if this review has or would offend him.

It is very impact resistant to the point of being almost indestructible. Once I accidentally hit a support beam/pillar with full force (don't ask -_-) and I found no trace of damage on the bokken. The only flaw I see is that polypropylene is not as dense as wood so the bokken is easily damaged by sharp objects and can be cut by bladed weapons.

      "__label__2 looking for the rest of the book: Broken was a bit of a disappointment. It is a quick read and not a bad book, but I was looking for a little bit more. There are a number of storylines that are introduced throughout the book, but none of them really mature. It left me wanting more, which isn't a problem that I normally have with Ms. Armstrong's books. Even the main storyline, with the portal unleashing a Jack the Ripper-like killer seemed shallow. There is little Pack interaction. The witches are only mentioned. Jamie pops in with a narrative hook, that goes nowhere. The newest vampire seems to be more comic relief than much else.As I'm reading, it occurred to me that the book, just well, seemed tired and other readershave commented that this is the last \"Elena\" book. Evidently, I'm not the only one thinking \"tired\" since there is a teaser for a new series by Armstrong in the back that looks interesting and different. It is about a woman \"completely of this world,\" according to the teaser.\n",

Shock value aside (incest and rape, along with a shocking surprise at the end), it read like a high-schooler's angsty prose. I found myself skipping through much of the overly-descriptive thought, just to get to the point. I rolled my eyes several times through plot twists as they were just plain absurd.The book is a quick read (I finished it in about an hour). I wish I had just taken it out at the library instead of spending $10 on something I can read in one sitting.All in all, the material is meant for 'mature' readers, but the style is clearly not. A lot of reviewers say that the 'love' between the main character and her brother is just 'beautiful', but I failed to see the beauty in animalistic um.... stuff between siblings. In my opinion, this book is purely shock value with no substance, so if that is your thing, then go for it.\n",

I also love the detailing of the sleeves, and the little pockets. The material is soft, and has the slightest sheen to it - I can't imagine it becomeing fuzzy or dull anytime soon. What I love most about the cardigan is that it is very versitile - so far I've worn it with tanks and turtlenecks, every color imaginable (I bought it in white). The versatility also means it can go with dressy, business and casual wear - and I've worn all three. It has become a staple in my wardrobe.\n",

Obviously, not a song critic; the author shows no appreciation at all for the lyrics and verse that captured, and still captures the world. The accounts of John Denver's personality were also written as fact instead of the farce that it is. Members of his family, children and ex-wives; continue to praise on camera-his gentleness and giving. This is not the book to read if you want insight into a man who gave the world his genius and his hope for a better world in the only way he knew to share this hope. He was, however, a man and problems he had with alcohol and relationships are outlined in his autobiography...and not very different from the evils many people face from day to day.\n",

      "__label__1 Poor quality: While the \"easy pour\" feature is nice, the plastic itself is very poor quality. It makes the milk smell plasticy, is fragile and leaks. Also, the area you write on is in the same place the milk is so it makes it hard to write and you also run the risk of puncturing the bag unless you use a permanent marker or something similar.

I thought rosamunde didnt really realize how rude she was and poor izzy had to go through her. i would have told her to shutup to listen to me. I think that Marco should have been punished. Marco should have been put into jail or his driver's license should have been taken away. I think Rosamunde should have been nicer.

She got really depressed because she was in a stuffy hospital and her room was just plain it wasn't different. Which she liked being different from everybody else. When she got to go home she found out she had to get a fake leg. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books that go slow, and are boring.

Izzy went on a date with a senior who she didn't really like and then went home with him even though he was drunk. She got in an accident and lost her leg. Abandoned by her \"friends\" she befriended an \"odd\" girl named Rosamunde who she'd never really liked before. Izzy was too absorbed in being liked and \"nice\" and I didn't understand why she would't take a ride home with the guy she had a crush on when he offered. I thought that the Izzy in her head that did cartwheels that she was always mentioning made no sense. I found the parts where Izzy was in the hospital really boring, and her parents bugged me. Instead of being happy that she'd made a friend who visited her and kept her happy, her mom was worried that Rosamunde wasn't Izzy's type. The story had no heart... it didn't make me like the characters, it didn't make me happy, it didn't make me sad, it was just boring.\n",

The replacement Duo has had lid-locking trouble as well, followed by, when 3 months' new, the screw holding the handle onto the pot continually getting loose but becoming stripped so that the pot/handle cannot be repaired. With my repeated calls and emails to Fagor customer service to get the pot repaired or replaced, I was discouraged by their slow and impersonal response; if they replied at all, it was with a cryptic one-line instruction and web-link to watch their long and complicated video on how to repair the pot myself!

I had high hopes because a full third of those pages dealt with Hannibal's boyhood where the author is at full license to use his imagination given the lack of historical detail for Hannibal. But it almost as though Mr Leckie gets bored and rushes through the end in order to begin writing Scipio. Historical inaccuracies aside, the life of Hannibal deserves a better account than the author has attempted and I think it is safe to say that the definitive fictional biography of Hannibal has yet to be written.

Will the yogurt look like or have the same type of consistency as store bought yogurt.....no. but it comes pretty close to it. I read some of the reviews saying that it does not make yogurt like you can buy in the store. To that I say \" you will be enjoying natural yogurt with more nutrition (probiotic). Store-bought yogurt actually defeats the whole purpose of eating yogurt with your meal. You can make store-bought like consistancy if you incorporate little bit of pectine or soluble fibre like agar agar powder. If you don't like the excess water in home made yogurt, it is better to strain the water out with a cheese cloth. In that case you don't have to add extra powder milk.\n",
      "__label__1 Is this made of gold? silver?: I was planning on getting this, but the price is way way too much. $199?? $500??? Retail value for this item is $27. There are other yogurt makers much cheaper. This item has been discontinued. Usually when a small kitchen appliance is discontinued it goes on clearance. It is important to note that this item does not churn ice cream, and it does not churn or freeze yogurt. This item merely heats to the proper temperature for making yogurt. The sellers who are selling this item are clearly unethical as anyone can see by the price. This is a yogurt maker and should be priced as such. Someone needs to get real and fix the price issue here. Amazon should not allow this sort of price gouging.\n",
      "__label__1 Too small, useless: So small, it holds just a quart of milk(4 cups). The milk has to be boiled (it doesn't do it). It just keeps the milk warm. You can make yogurt yourself without it. You can use container with lid to keep the milk warm. You don't need to pay money to keep the milk warm.\n",
      "__label__2 Low-cost, Delicious and Easy-to-make Yogurt!: I got the Salton YM9 yogurt maker for Christmas of 2004, so I've had a full year to really test the machine and hone my yogurt-making skills. The Salton yogurt maker is a no-frills, budget appliance; it is not one of those fancy, gourmet Euro-Cuisine or Donvier makers, which come with individual-sized glass jars and cost twice as much as the Salton. No, the Salton YM9 is a plastic, plug-in model, and it does the job FINE. I wanted to make my own yogurt because store-bought yogurt is costly, and, if you read most ingredient labels, is often made with high-fructose corn syrup. I prefer the 1-quart container because I make a big batch of plain yogurt once a week, and then add pureÃ©d frozen fruit and Splenda to flavor it as I desire. It's a healthful breakfast food or snack. I highly recommend this item.\n",
      "__label__1 OK machine, but not what I expected.: I bought two of this item because people said that a 1 quart Mason jar fit inside it perfectly. Unfortunately, since those reviews were written, the design must have changed because quart sized mason jars do not fit the yogurt makers that were delivered to me. The glass jars are too narrow and too tall to work well with it. Now, unless I can find a short fat quart jar, I am stuck with the plastic liner that came with the set. Very disappointed. :(\n",

It deserves more than a 5 star rating.\n",
      "__label__2 Yogurt Supreme: The Salton YM9 is easy to use. The explicit directions in the manual are simple to follow. The yogurt produced is excellent. The plastic scoop spoon that comes with the YM9 is unnecessary. I like the 1 quart size rather than hassling with several small containers. Cleanup is a breeze and the YM9 is an attractive appliance. Make sure you have a candy thermometer as you will be preheating milk and mixing starter only after the milk has dropped to the right temperature. (note to Salton: dump the spoon and include thermometer) The YM9 is an inexpensive, easy to use, effective product...enjoy!\n",
      "__label__2 Awesome: I have made almond milk yogurt using both apple and honey sweeteners, cashew milk yogurt, sprouted soy bean yogurt and sunflower yogurt which I made into cheese. The thing is totally versatile. I had to buy a non-dairy starter, but the people at Custom Probiotics made that simple, too. Easy to use; easy to clean. The yogurts I have made have fermented 4 - 8 hours with no problems. Altogether a great buy.\n",

Basically they aren't willing to change their diet at all. Everything has to be fresh adn organic and they still try to buy the same expensive products they always have (plus where are they shopping? It looks like a Whole Foods or Central Market - NOT somewhere people on food stamps would actually be able to afford). They constantly complain about how they aren't full and they can't afford desert. They even have friends over for dinner - as if you can afford to feed your friends when you can't even afford to feed yourslef. I watched this with a group of people - liberals and conservatives - and everyone equally hated it. I guess any idiot can make a documentary these days and call it factual. Don't waste your time.\n",

In this bi- and tri-lingual text, he has justified my confidence in him.The poets translated in the volume have a varied amount of \"Indian-ness\" - some speak the Indian language of the group with which they identify, some do not. The poems themselves range from poems that show a non-Spanish aesthetic to those that are openly \"Spanish\" in some sense. For example, a poem by Jaime Luis Huenun is titled \"After Reading So Much Cesar Vallejo\", and three poems of Graciela Huinao remind me of the sparseness of haiku.My favorite of the poets in Elicura Chihuailaf whose poems center around blue - a color with strong ties to the Indian culture. These poems are perhaps the most Indian, but the poems are universal in the depiction of humanity and its relationship to the rest of nature while being accessible and particular in terms of images.These poems are well worth your time.\n",

Deviant Ways has an interesting, although not very original, plot and it does have its moments of excitement. However, the characters never came to life for me and I found I gave up on caring what happened to them. Further, the \"bad guy\" seriously lacked credibility. It came to a point that I found myself skimming through the last third of the book, and the only real thrill I got from Deviant Ways was when I came to its end. Do yourself a favor and skip this book, but do read Remembering Sarah by Mooney.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointed: I have loved all of John Irving's other books. I was excited to read this one, but I was quite disappointed. The storytelling and the plot are usual Irving style, but Ruth's (the main character) relationship with Hannah as well her lovers are surprisingly superficial and unbelievable. Irving's usual ironic humor is missing, and there doesn't seem to be anything taking it's place.\n",
      "__label__1 At least I bought it in a sale: John Irving is a very talented storyteller which is why I bought A Widow for One Year. However, I couldn't even finish (in italics) this book. I became annoyed early on when Irving describes Eddie as carrying \"a heavy duffel bag and a lighter, smaller suitcase\". Unfortunately he does this about ten (in italics) times in as many pages. After the third time I was mentally screaming \"ENOUGH ALREADY. I GET THE PICTURE. 'LUGGAGE' IS OKAY NOW.\" Irving's constant use of italics is also extremely (in italics) helpful. I couldn't have possibly worked out the nuances of the conversation for myself. NOT. Combined with the thin and dreary plot, this work is not exactly a page turner. More of a page churner.\n",
      "__label__1 A major disappointment from one of my favourite authors.: Although this book starts off quite promisingly and quite thrillingly I found it quickly descended into a contrived and finally uninteresting story. The plot twists were unbelievable and the characters motivations were, at times, ridiculous. Unfortunately, after the last two superb books: A Prayer for Owen Meany and A Son of the Circus, this was a major disappointment.\n",
      "__label__1 A Widow for One Year: This has to be the most boring novel I have read. In fact, once I put it down, I found that it is virtually impossible to pick it up again. However, since I bought the book, I picked it up again, at about page 106, only to put it down again at page 232. I doubt if I'll ever start again. The book stinks.\n",
      "__label__1 A disappointment: I love John Irving. He is a funny, quirky and captivating writer who often hits me right in the centre of my heart.That's the problem with this book. Its as if he is TRYING to be quirky, that he knows that is his hallmark. Instead, his characters come of seeming flawed or pathetic. The book started out where a tragedy is announced and I was immediately pulled into the novel and ready for some heartwrenching times.Instead, as the book progressed, I had trouble reading it becuase it seemed like he was just trying to hard or something.If you read Prayer for Owen Meany, then Son of the Circus, then you read this book, you are in for a big disappointment.\n",
      "__label__1 Please don't bother with this one: \"A Widow for One Year\" was my first John Irving book, and it might be my last. While I thought the plot was interesting (at first), it quickly went downhill from there. Irving cluttered up the novel with extempraneous details and subplots that did nothing to help me to the end. If anything, they were deterrents along the way. I didn't love, or even like, any of the characters. And Hannah was a nightmareÃ‘I found myself wondering why Ruth (or anyone) would ever be friends with her. It was such an effort to finish the book that I vow never to force myself to read such drivel again. The only thing that I looked forward to in this book was finishing it so I could start a new oneÃ‘by a different author.But, I hear \"A Prayer for Owen Meany\" is well worth the read. However, the next Irving book I pick up will be from the library, as I can't bear to spend more money on anything that has the slightest chance of being so mundane.\n",

I did not care in the least for Ruth Cole, the main focus of the book, or any of the other drab people we meet along this sad journey. If this is the only John Irving book you have read and you didn't like it - don't do yourself a disservice - please buy and savor his previous fine novels.

      "__label__2 \"New\" Irving Fan: Having just read two of John Irvings books,(Cider House Rules) I am new to the phenomenon of Mr. Irving. However, I must agree with his most ardent fans, he is a wonderful storyteller. A novel that will totally submege you into the world of its characters. Even the \"weakest\" character is so well developed that you love him more for his weaknesses. Also my edition had an interview with the author at the end of the book. It was so enlightening. Read it only after you finish... I have now decided that my next two Irving books will be Garp and Prayer for Owen Meaney. Both these novels have been tranformed to the \"big Screen\". Having seen Cider House on the big screen, I saw all that was missing. I am looking forward to reading these two and rediscovering the world according to Irving.\n",
      "__label__1 I knew it wouldn't be Owen Meany and was STILL disappointed: John Irving seemed to be presenting his story of Ruth Cole as if from a great distance. His narrative seemed often to be building up to something - as if it were all deep background -- that never happened. Astounding coincidences aside, the narrative was so sparse, so clinical (and pretty crude)that it was really difficult to relate to any of the characters. For example, it was hard to imagine why Ruth Cole and Hannah were \"best friends\" as they acted like they only hurt and annoyed each other. They didn't seem to understand or to comfort each other. It was as if Irving said they were best friends, so they were, but there was no reason to believe. I did like the narrative devices that Irving used, including Ruth's postcards and journals as a chapter, and one of her short stories. It enriched what was otherwise a sparse narrative. In all, the first section was the most compelling, the rest... not so much.\n",
      "__label__1 Dull and lifeless after the first 100 pages: Mr. Irving starts off strong, with interesting well drawn characters. However, after the first section, there is nothing that's either interesting, compelling or particularly well written. It's my guess that Mr. Irving started a pretty good novel and either to explain or excuse his purient interest in prostitutes, tried to steer his good opening into a trite story about and unlikeable writer and her purient interest in prostitutes. I guess if nothing else, this book helped Mr. Irving explain to his wife and the IRS why he needed to hang out in Amsterdam's red light district.\n",

No such luck. I was relatively bored by Ruth as a main character. Her raucus friend Hannah seemed more interesting. And- big deal about the older woman, 16 yr. old boy story. Shocking? Not really. If the story was about Eddie's life after this love affair, it would have been much more colorful. Not much room in this book for titilation either, lest a murder get in the way. Yawn. Drawbacks: boring, and slightly interesting from chapter to chapter Positives: At least there was some resolution of conflicts- or hint at it. Loved the ending. Clever final dialogue.\n",
      "__label__1 Such a disappointment: It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote the extraordinary Cider House Rules. It felt to me like one long (in Irving fashion) rebuttal letter to his critics. This book was transparently Irving's forum for justifying, through character Ruth, his style and choices in past works. If you read the book, you'll understand. Yes, I believe a man can write from a woman's viewpoint. No, I don't believe Irving was able to pull it off in Widow. The book read like a Sidney Sheldon novel. The only difference is that (so far) it's not embarrassing to read a John Irving book on the bus. The story was entirely predictable, the writing simplistic and even dumbed-down and the cliches ran rampant. I was expecting something more heady from one of my favorite American authors.\n",

      "__label__1 Really a big letdown.: I, too, feel I must chime in and express my disappointment in this book. The subject matter is fascinating; I've been interested in End Times prophecy for quite some time. After hearing Kathleen on Art Bell's show, I ordered the book eagerly. There were some major delays with the book's arrival, but that's another matter.The writing is of poor quality. The book's production values seem to be not quite up to par. The fact that so much of the book was based on the Lueken work was the most shocking part of it all. The supply list in the back of the book smacked of hucksterism.I, too, am sorry I bought this book, and urge those who are interested in this sort of material to look elsewhere, starting with Father Malachi Martin's books. Fr. Martin's books will stand the test of time; this book will not.\n",

Before I read the book, I had heard Ms. Keating on the radio. I did my own looking into the subject matter she had spoken about. I can tell you that she is absolutely credible. The book is interesting, but moreover, will prove an invaluable survival tool in the probable future we are racing toward.\n",

The line about packing the china (which another reviewer picked up on) was hilarious. This just strikes me as a \"quick-and-dirty\" effort, more attention being paid to getting it out and making money off it than to actual content and information.

He also seemed to be emulating \"Bonfire of the Vanities\" in early chapters, but without success. Some of the dialog made me wince.\n",

      "__label__2 They're not from England!: Just to clear something up that was mentioned by another review, the Tender Idols are not from England. They are from Atlanta, Georgia.Anyway, that's not really the issue. The Tenders Idols have been around for a while (check out the haggered face of the guitarist - he looks like John Lennon after Yoko had sucked the life out of him) and Distressor is their third album. It's also their best, possibly because they have themselves a fairly new - and extremely talented - bassist in Joe Jones.Distressor is a mix of everything associated with Brit pop with a little punk and heavy rock thrown in for good measure. It's nothing very innovative or particularly new, but it's a very well produced album that is the kind of CD I like to listen to when I write. They're a solid band who deserve to start getting some recognition soon.\n",

      "__label__1 Is Aleister Crowley boring? Is that possible?: It's a shame that this book is so tedious, because the author knows his subject. I read Lawrence Sutin's biography of PK Dick and I was impressed, so I had high hopes for this one. But there's no structure to the story, no plot. Sutin moves from one moment of Crowley's life to the next, never making it clear if he's describing a high point, a low point, a turning point, etc. Halfway through, I promised myself I'd finish the book, sure that as Crowley's life reached the end, Sutin would bring things to a climax. But he didn't. Sutin knows the facts but didn't present them in a compelling way.\n",
      "__label__1 Beginner romance: While Wolf has written other novels that I have enjoyed, this one felt like Introduction to Historical Romance 101. The characters were not in the least complicated, nor was the story line. The language and style felt as if it were intended for a very YOUNG female audience...Nell would be interesting to a sixteen to twenty-one year old reader, but not to one with more mature sensibilities. Even the vocabulary felt simplified. This does not make this a bad book, merely one that I could not recommend to anyone with any understanding of the period, or who wanted a more fully developed love story. It might be a good book to use to introduce your daughter or granddaughter to Historical Romance novels (but I'd prefer something there with more life to it and better characters). The sex scenes are tepid, the characters are one-dimensional, and there is a lot of internal prayer and moralising, if you like that sort of thing.\n",

I can't wait for the movie!\n",
      "__label__1 Disapointing: How can the author of Good in Bed produce such drivel? I am sorely disapointed with the sophmore release!

The Unrepentant, and 15. Christmas In Washington. This 2000 concert presents a striking contrast from Steve Earl's performance in 1986 at the same venue during his \"clean cut\" days. Steve has grown tremendously over the years as both a singer and a song writer. Damn... Steve on mandolin on Copperhead Road is priceless. Love Copperhead Road! This is a must have DVD for Steve Earle fans, and if you happen to have his 1986 performance you will come close to having complete concert footage spanning most of his career. The sound quality and video are satisfactory.\n",
      "__label__2 Helps Maintain Existing Strength: I've been going to the gym for about 5 years pretty consistently now. I try to get there at least 3 times a week, but during the busy holiday months that doesn't always happen. I normally use muscle milk, but decided to give this a try after seeing it. While I didn't really notice too much increase of energy nor gains while using this, I was able to keep my muscle mass and the amount of weight I am pushing at the gym consistent even when only going once or twice a month so I think it works pretty well. So maybe if you use this every day and lift almost every day you would see better gains, but I really just wanted to maintain and it helped me with that so I would use it again.\n",
      "__label__2 Just the best: We shopped around on the internet and decided to go with the T-Fal Fit 'N Clean for these reasons: it has an upper and lower heating element, variable temp control, and you can put the whole unit in the dishwasher.

      "__label__1 Immature, unlikeable main character.: I was excited to read this book because the title indicated that it could be a compelling book. Instead, it was so boiler plate that I knew from almost the outset who was responsible and it was a chore to have to read through it just to find out what I already knew. Also, the characters were just dull or in the case of Meagan, annoying. The entire plot of her involvement in questioning a suspect was unbelievable. Actually, the entire book could have been a high school writing project.\n",
      "__label__1 Somewhat disappointed: After reading the great reviews, I was really looking forward to this book. But I was disappointed. The author's prose was excellent, and the story well conceived. But the only compelling character happens to be the victim, Dr. Diana Duprey, whose story is told through flashbacks. She is a multi-layered and very interesting character. Her husband Frank is bland, and her daughter Megan is a spoiled brat. I wanted to reach out and choke her halfway through the book. The \"romance,\" if you can call it that, between Megan and the detective seemed unnecessary and not believable. I also saw the ending coming a mile away. I kept waiting for a twist at the end, but it didn't come.\n",
      "__label__1 Somewhat Helpful but Disappointing: One of the best things about the book was it mentioning to do the NCAA 101. Unfortunately, you cannot do that in the game! Having the information available about the schools (over half of the book) and their favorite plays was helpful. So was the descriptions of the plays. However, the play images did not include player movement, which is crucial -- there is no excuse to \"save space\" for such crucial information -- one of the big reasons for such books is to be able to carry it and not have to have the game in front of you. The instructions and strategy are good, but not great. Helpful but disappointing.\n",

      "__label__2 If you like rice cakes, these are a great choice: Let's face it, there are 2 types of people in this world: those who like rice cakes & those who don't.

Popcorn flavor is light, but it does have more flavor than the plain ones.\n",
      "__label__2 Zippo Lighter Fluid: Zippo fluid burns much cleaner than most others, so its far easier to keep my lighter clean. Of course there is a bit of odor to the fluid, but I personally like it (yeah yeah.. don't say it). I've seen some of these cans leak at the cap when tilted, but mine doesn't. Its simple enough to grab and pour fluid into a Zippo, even being the large 12oz can.I'm not saying anything that others already haven't, so I'll end with this. If you want your Zippo to stay reasonably clean, not stink horribly, and burn consistently... get the Zippo brand. Other brands will work, just not as well.\n",

I've been told by zippo enthusiasts that you can use different fuels in your zippo, but this will always be popular because it has the zippo logo on it. The fuel itself smells exactly like lighter fluid that you put on your grill and comes in a metal canister.*NOTE* When I first got this, I pried the nozzle up and it flung zippo fluid in my EYE. Be careful when opening the container. Also, it comes out very fast and if you're not careful will leak onto things.\n",

I just want to say how wonderfully interesting this book was: I wasn't able to put it down.I didn't loathe any characters (strange for me) and had fallen in love with several of them by the end of the story.

      "__label__1 Am I missing something?: After reading all the glowing reviews for this game, I cannot believe how incredibly dull and tedious it was. I gave up in the middle of the third case. The only reason I got that far was that I assumed I was missing something, that surely it must get better. I did not find this game to be challenging at all, it's a matter of reading through page after page of text, clicking on everything in a room to get all the evidence, and presenting everything you've got in court. I see no comparison between this and games where you actually have to solve puzzles, like Myst or the Nancy Drew games.\n",
      "__label__2 Nontraditional, but entertaining.: This is, simply put, not a game for everyone. This isn't a 'shoot em up', or action adventure. You play the role of, duh, Phoenix Wright, a young attorney just starting out. You gather evidence, follow the leads, and question witnesses on the stand, trapping them in their own lies.If you're the type who loves looking for all the details, twisted wordplay, and loves a good puzzle, this is your game. If all you're looking for is mindless violence, feel free to pass.\n",
      "__label__1 Poor Film Making at Its Finest: Bloody awful. Character actions lack motivation, logic, or explanation. Acting is brilliantly mediocre. Dialogue, what little there is between flashbacks and dream sequences, lacks punch and believability. Plot--if it can be called that--is tedious. Scenes drag on and on. It's pretty much a given that gay cinema sucks; this film does nothing to dispel that notion. I thought the directors' other film, \"Shank,\" was dreadful, but this...wow...even worse.\n",

The title is less than honest but is only slightly justified by the instruction to go to a certain website for more about the used car business, but that information is kindergarten level stuff which can be obtained free on most any online search engine.

I pretty much don't even read the words but rather am descriptive for my son, I will read it \"when Ernie has to pee-pee or poopie\". I would not recommend this as a real learning experience for your child, but as I said my son does enjoy looking at it.\n",

      "__label__1 a lot of noise, but not much music: Slow going, this movie hardly managed to keep my attention. It plays a lot like a made-for-TV film. And yet, the movie contains a great monologue by its main character about what heaven and hell are and how it's the summation in our brain's reactions to our entire lives that determines the way we spend our eternity.\n",
      "__label__2 SPECIAL: NOW, NOW, NOW! In this age of hi-tech and instant gratification it is not proper to restore [retouch] everything to pristine quality [imagine tampering with the Mona Lisa because it looks too drab!]. Sure this DVD has flaws [the horrid Anglo dubbing should go - keep the original French and give us subtitles]. However, this is pure nostalgia, the flavor and essence of Piaf and her amours [the breathtaking Marcel, cut in his prime] - then Theo.Marlene Dietrich, Josephine Baker, Jean Marais, Cocteau, Romy Schneider, Alain Delon, Jean Paul Belmondo, etc. we get glimpses of the not so distant past - this is a perfect mood piece, instead of an 'in your face' documentary.A must have for the serious collector.\n",
      "__label__1 For devoted fans only: This DVD should be viewed by devoted fans only and preferably French speaking fans at that. The picture quality is extremely poor, the appearances of Piaf are cobbled together and the sound is atrocius. It's dedinitely not one for the average viewer!\n",
      "__label__1 Big dissappointment: Essentially, the problem for me was that the dubbing was done so obtrusively and so poorly that it becomes painfully embarrassing to watch this DVD in English (which is the only option.)Subtitles would have done the trick nicely, enabling us to hear the people onscreen yet understand them. When Piaf talks, her voice is immediately paved over by the voice of non-actor reading a translation of Piaf's words.Beyond that, it seemed a bit ragtag as a documentary -- some interesting details, but it all feels rather like an inexpensively made TV special that makes do with whatever odds and ends are most readily available.\n",
      "__label__1 Cybershoot DSCS90: I've been a Sony fan as long as I remember, but this product is the worst Sony ever made.Picture qulity is bad, it won't take a high capacity memory stick, it's big and heavy.I'm looking for a diffrent camara now and this one is going to be my little girl toy.\n",

Well I needed it for a school project tomorrow and guess what... it's dead! It will let me look at the pictures I took three months ago, but nothing else... it instantly shuts right back off.Better yet, after an hour of internet research, apparently several people have had this problem... so I dug out my old SONY camera. It took two good pictures and then the picture/video card fried! It literally started trembling in my hand.I'm done with Sony... last month our two year old Sony DVD player died too. This used to be the best quality company around, now they've obviously turned to crap.\n",

The dry winter weather and heat and sun in the summer just ruin my hair, so I need a daily shampoo and conditioner that actually keeps my hair healthy. I am really happy with this stuff, however Bed Head exaggerates it's products (humorous marketing tactic?), so this is not the ultimate cure for dry hair. I still use a clarifying shampoo and deep hydrating mask twice/week, but this is an excellent in between solution!\n",

He's a game warden trainee who becomes involved in a murder when a local outfitter's body appears in his woodpile. The plot concerning greedy business interests versus a thought-to-be-extinct mammal in Wyoming's beautiful wilderness is familiar, but the characterizations are great. Joe is a courageous yet flawed hero; his wife, Marybeth, is loving yet headstrong. What happens to the characters in this novel is reflected in their emotional growth over the next books in the series and often has devastating consequences. A great read.\n",
      "__label__2 Good First book: Even though you could tell this was a first of a series with a little disjointed story to start, it quickly picked up and was a very fun read. It kept my interest through out and the end threw some great twist. I recomend this and have already bought the next two in the series.\n",

      "__label__1 Skip this one, even if you like the VSI series: This book is neither very short nor a proper introduction. In this case, the title is totally misleading.With respect to length, the book drones on and on, and took me a surprisingly long time to finish considering the modest number of pages.With respect to being an introduction, the author seems more interested in showing his expertise rather than guiding those new to the subject. He spends a lot of time on esoterica, while failing to clearly present the basics of linguistics.For a truly good introduction, I suggest \"Teach Yourself Linguistics\" by Aitchison, which is well organized, concise, and covers all of the basics. Also check out the excellent audio/video linguistics courses offered by \"The Teaching Company.\"\n",

Discs scratched up worse than the first on some of them. One disc won't read properly. The worst scratched disc in both sets is disc 5, although 3 was scratched in both sets as was 4. Either the manufacturer is messing up or the case they're in is messing up the discs.The same thing happened with Merlin Season 2. I had to order twice because the first set was scratched. The second one was ok. So out of 4 ordered, only 1 set was non-scratched.I like the show. But these DVD sets are junk. I'd only buy the next ones locally so I could keep returning it until I get a good set.\n",

The basic unit meet my expectations with non rusting materials and a chrome finish. However the set screws provided were simple carbon steel. If used, these set screws would soon rust and the product and the tile floor would be stained. I had to purchase stainless steel set screws to assemble and install the units.\n",
      "__label__1 Buyer Beware: I bought the individual volumes 1 & 2. Combined, they have the exact same run time as the Complete Series set according to Amazon. However, the episode \"Imprint\" is not included in either volume. I wrote to Starz/Anchor Bay and they claim it IS on the big set. What a ripoff! It's bad enough they said they'd never release the full season in order to sucker people into buying the original individual releases. Now they pull this nonsense.\n",

I talked to tech support and they know there is a problem and are trying to fix it. This is not acceptable. The 2006 version has a different database than the prior versions, and it has made the file much larger and for some much slower. I had to buy a new version because I use their payroll services and my 2003 is being fazed out April 30. I have just now bought the 2005 an Ebay. After printing the audit trail, I was able to record all my transactions while in the 2006 version onto my restored 2003 version and then upgraded to 2005. I know this seems like alot of work, but the 2006 was that bad for me.\n",

I wasn't disappointed in her latest, Dark Sky. It was an exciting, nail biting adventure.

But what record company exec, in his right mind, could green-light this awful album?The 18-49 crowd will find it absolutely laughable, and Paul's core audience (50's and up) will just scratch their heads and say, \"What the....?\"There are two laugh-out-loud songs on this CD. Trust me, I played it for several people, and the reaction was unanimous. \"Mr. Brightside\" and \"Against the Wind.\" Did Bob Seger actually okay this? What is he smoking these days?Again, can't figure out A) who would buy this, and B) who could possibly find it good.A friend gave it to me as a \"gag.\" And I just about did.Paul, thanks for your good work back in the day.

Rock Swings was an amazing record with an unexpected selection of tunes, and nearly every one of them meticulously treated to a terrific swing interpretation. I was hoping for another helping, but alas my strong suspicion is that this album is the tracks that didn't make it on Rock Swings.

      "__label__1 Piece of Junk: The product arrived damaged, not from shipping damage, but from packing at the factory. Too damaged to use. Dealer said they didn't want it back. It's a good thing, because it was replaced by a unit that wouldn't run. I took the fan unit (which wan't damaged) out of the damaged unit and put it in the second unit and it runs, but only at a low fan speed. Anything higher causes too much vibration noise. Also, both units we received were poorly finished, with the base being several shades lighter than the cover, which matches the picture on the box. It looks like they only gave the bottom one coat of stain. Thanks to the dealer who refunded our money. My email with complaints directly to the manufacturer got no response.\n",

      "__label__1 Essick Humidifier - Poor Quality: As several other reviewers discovered, this product (Essick Air 696-400 humidifier) is lacking in quality. The cabinet is flimsy, the unit is noisy, and the wick is a disaster! Poor engineering from the word GO.The variable speed control causes the motor to hum loudly when used at lower speeds. This hum is amplified by the thin, light-weight, plastic cabinet. When the motor is turned up to higher speeds the fan creates an unacceptable level of noise.The first time I cleaned the wick, following the directions in the owners care & use manual, the paper element began collapsing and would have completely fallen out had I not caught it in time.I seriously regret spending so much money on such an inferior product!\n",

Actually, it created the same hiss even when I turned Drive and Gain all the way down. So I sent it back.I am one of very few people who report this problem about the TubePre, which is why I suspect that there might be a small number of defective boxes out there.Too bad, it looked good on paper, I liked the VU display and had been looking forward to experimenting with different tubes.I ordered the VTB-1 instead, I hope that is going to work for me.\n",

During the winter, when the bedroom gets so dry, the humidifier really does the trick. And, it may be in our heads, but the air really does seem to be cleaner than in the rest of the house.This product has great air quality ratings (HEPA, etc.) relative to other products in its price range, and was easy to set up, etc.Our only gripe is that it is a bit of a pain to clean. You need to take it all apart, etc. However, this may be the case with all of these products, and thus, may just be par for the course.We recommend this product whole-heartedly.\n",

This is it, while resolution is not as good as other camaras, if you need it for web applications its good enough. One very good feature, at least for me, is its great macro capability and manual focus. You can take objects as close as 1 cm. You can also control the exposure level which for close distance shots is a very usefull feature. But the best feature for me is the fact that it stores in floppy disks. This is a convenient storage media and while the storage capacity is not big, they are so cheap you can buy as many as you need. Overall I'm very happy with it, I strongly recommend it.\n",

This is a movie about friendship, love, loss, sadness, and the general simplicities in life that are usually over looked. This movie was definitely sad and also made me happy. I enjoyed the many meaningful messages presented throughout the movie. There are many great quotes and provides a different view of how life can be perceived and how life is changing. At most, I would say this movie provides a wonderful message about friendship. A genuine friendship that is rare today. You can do many fancy things to prove you are \"best friends,\" but does your friendship provide you a sense of hope and inspiration? \"You are my best friend. You are my only friend.\" One person can make a difference in a persons life, as Mary and Max had did for one another.\n",

Usage of this item even as only a simple ashtray is not possible as the holders are so small that any cigarette of normal size does not fit.The item is made of what is clearly the cheapest materials and it shows in the workmanship.
